# Arrays in JavaScript  

## Overview  
Arrays are one of the most important data structures in JavaScript. They are used to store multiple values in a single variable and come with powerful methods for adding, removing, and manipulating data. This guide provides a comprehensive explanation of arrays and their various operations.

### 1. Introduction to Arrays  

An array is a collection of values, which can be of any data type (string, number, object, etc.). Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the first element has an index of `0`.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
console.log(fruits); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```  

**Key Points:**  
- Arrays can hold mixed data types.  
- Arrays are mutable, meaning their contents can be changed.  

---

### 2. Push, Pop, Shift, Unshift  

These methods are used to manipulate arrays.  

- **`push`:** Adds an element to the end of the array.  
- **`pop`:** Removes the last element from the array.  
- **`unshift`:** Adds an element to the beginning of the array.  
- **`shift`:** Removes the first element from the array.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
fruits.push("cherry"); // ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.pop();          // ["apple", "banana"]
fruits.unshift("mango"); // ["mango", "apple", "banana"]
fruits.shift();          // ["apple", "banana"]
console.log(fruits);
```

### 3. Primitive vs Reference Data Types  

Primitive types (e.g., `number`, `string`, `boolean`) are stored by value, while reference types (e.g., `arrays`, `objects`) are stored by reference.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = a;
b = 20;
console.log(a); // 10 (primitive stored by value)

let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = arr1;
arr2.push(4);
console.log(arr1); // [1, 2, 3, 4] (reference stored by reference)
```  

---

### 4. Clone Array & Spread Operator  

You can clone arrays using the spread operator or other methods like `slice()`.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
let original = [1, 2, 3];
let clone = [...original];
clone.push(4);

console.log(original); // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(clone);    // [1, 2, 3, 4]
```  

---

### 5. For Loop  

The `for` loop is commonly used to iterate through arrays.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
let numbers = [10, 20, 30];
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  console.log(numbers[i]);
}
```  

---

### 6. Using `const` for Creating Arrays  

Arrays declared with `const` cannot be reassigned, but their contents can be modified.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4); // Allowed
// arr = [5, 6]; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
console.log(arr);
```  

---

### 7. While Loop in Arrays  

A `while` loop can also iterate over arrays, especially when the number of iterations is not fixed.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let i = 0;
while (i < arr.length) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
  i++;
}
```  

---

### 8. For...of Loop  

The `for...of` loop provides an elegant way to iterate through array elements.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for (let fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}
```  

---

### 9. For...in Loop  

The `for...in` loop iterates over the indices of an array.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for (let index in fruits) {
  console.log(`Index: ${index}, Value: ${fruits[index]}`);
}
```  

---

### 10. Array Destructuring  

Array destructuring allows you to unpack values into variables.  

**Code Example:**  
```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
let [first, second] = fruits;
console.log(first); // "apple"
console.log(second); // "banana"
```  

**Advanced Example:**  
```javascript
let numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];
let [a, , c] = numbers; // Skipping the second element
console.log(a); // 10
console.log(c); // 30
```
